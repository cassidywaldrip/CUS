## Objectives

In this lab we will get familiar with mobility data by collecting, storing and analyzing our own mobility data. Specifically we will learn how

- To enable [Google Timeline](google.com/maps/timeline) on our mobile phones
- To collect our own mobility data
- Familiarize ourselves with tris and visits mobility data
- Prepare the data for analysis
- Once we have enough data, we will analyze it in future labs.

::: callout-note

## Mobile Phone and Google Maps set up

[Google Timeline](google.com/maps/timeline) (previously known as Google Location History) enables to collect and visualize your location history using your mobile phone. To set it up you will need:

-   A smartphone with Google Maps App installed: [iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) or [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en_US&pli=1)

-   A Google account and you need to set up Google Maps to [login in to](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/2803351?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) your account.

## Location settings and Google Timeline

To start collecting your mobility/location data, we will use the [Google Maps Timeline](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6258979?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Csave-your-search-browsing-activity-with-google). The Timeline is a personal map that helps you remember routes and trips you've taken and places you've been based on your Location history.

We need to do two things:

-   **Activate your Location for Google Maps**: Go to your Location settings and allow Google Maps to collection your location. This setting is different in different operating systems. You have the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6258979?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=0#zippy=%2Csave-your-search-browsing-activity-with-google). For example in iPhone you have to
    1.  On your iPhone or iPad, open the Google Maps app.
    2.  Tap your *Profile Picture* or *Initials* and then *Settings*.
    3.  Tap **Personal content** \> **Location settings.**
    4.  Under “Location settings,” check that it says “Location Services is on.” If it doesn’t, tap **Location Services is not set to always** \> **Location** \> **Always**.
-   **Check the timeline has been created**:
    1.  On your mobile phone, open the Google Maps app.
    2.  Tap your *Profile Picture* or *Initials* and then **Your timeline**.
    3.  You will get today's mobility activity. If you have activated the Timeline previous, check it is storing your past mobility by going to another day.
    4.  If you want to have regular backups, click on the cloud icon next to **Timeline** at the top
