## How do I export my assigments to canvas?

Coming...

## Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using `stella`?

The short answer is, I'd rather you didn't, to save yourself some headache, specially to access the data in the server. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we're using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. We are happy to help you as much as we can: we can't guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we're happy to try.

If you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:

-   Download and install the last version of `R`: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   Download and install a daily build of `RStudio`: <https://dailies.rstudio.com/>
-   Install Quarto CLI: <https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html>
-   Install Git: <https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html>
-   Install any necessary packages with `install.packages("___")`

And I'd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is **not** a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that [here](/computing-access.html).
