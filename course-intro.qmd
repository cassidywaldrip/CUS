# Introduction

Computational urban science (or its other names) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that applies computational methods and large-scale datasets to study and address urban challenges. It combines insights and techniques from many disciplines, including social sciences, economics, physics, urban planning, data science, and computer science, to explore the dynamics of cities, the effects of urban environments, the lifestyles and decision-making of city dwellers, and the effects of policies and interventions.

The capacity to collect and analyze massive amounts of data has transformed fields like social sciences, political sciences, economics, and urban science. To date, understanding human behavior in cities has relied mainly on static and small datasets like the census, travel surveys, or personal surveys. The development of new digital technologies, especially mobile phones, offers a detailed description of people's activities, movements, and interactions over extended periods and at a population scale. The availability of those digital fingerprints has transformed how we look at urban challenges, given the ability to accurately understand "micro" individuals' decision-making and the possibility of learning how "macro" urban dynamics evolve over time. As in many other fields, massively collected data has allowed us to map out intricate connections between urban environments, policies and interventions, and individuals' and groups' decisions to understand and predict better urban challenges.

This brief essay will explore the key concepts, methods, and applications of computational urban science. We will also discuss the field's interdisciplinary nature, highlighting the role of data science, causal and network analysis, simulation modeling, and machine learning in uncovering previously inaccessible patterns and insights. Finally, we will touch on the ethical considerations and challenges of using large-scale data, particularly those related to ensuring privacy, fairness, and inclusivity in urban research and decision-making.

We will emphasize using data and computational methods to uncover the "why" behind urban challenges rather than focusing solely on the "how, who, where, and when." By digging into the root causes and mechanisms driving these issues, we aim to reveal deeper insights that can lead to more impactful and sustainable solutions.

Through this discussion, we hope to show the transformative power of computational urban science and the need to adopt data-driven approaches to understanding the complex dynamics of model urban life. We will go over the main pillars of this perspective, exploring why cities matter (Urban), how computational techniques and large-scale data enable new insights (Computational), and how scientific principles tie these findings together (Science).

# Urban

Urban areas and the epicenters of human activity, driving economic growth, innovation, and cultural exchanges @betancourt. Around 54% of the world's population now lives in cities, and projections indicate that by 2050, cities are expected to house 68% of the total population @un2018world. In some areas, like North America or Europe, around 80% of people live in urban areas, compared to just 40% in 1900.

![Growth of population in Urban areas](images/urbanization_chart.jpg){fig-align="left" width="600"}

Urban areas are not only attracting more people but also increasingly concentrating more resources and outcomes. For example, cities generate over 80% of the world's GDP. The economy of the New York City (NYC) is as large as that of Canada. If it were a separate country, NYC it would be the world's 12$^{th}$ largest economy. Almost 63% of all U.S. patents are developed by people living in just 20 metro areas @rothwell2013patenting. In general, urban areas benefit from **economies of scale** or, more precisely, from **economies of agglomeration**, the idea that grouping economic activities is more productive than spreading them out. This leads to increasing labor productivity, higher worker wages @shutters_urbanization_2022, and more diverse industries and skill sets, creating more employment opportunities @hong_universal_2020.

\<-- Social capital, social connnections? --\>

However, cities are also home to some of the most critical problems in our societies. Estimates suggest that **urban areas are responsible for 70% of global CO**$_2$ emissions, with transport and buildings being among the most significant contributors @IPCC2022. The surge of private vehicles has led to traffic congestion, pollution, and lost productivity. Public transit systems are often underfunded and inefficient, while new mobility solutions, such as ride-sharing and micro-mobility options, rather than solving it, are intensifying the problem @diao2021.

While cities are hubs of opportunity, they are also of stark economic disparity. Cities are not uniformly places of wealth and abundance. Even the most prosperous metro areas are a patch of concentrated affluent and disadvantaged areas @florida_new_2017, which impacts their residents' opportunities and challenges existing governance models. Large cities are more economically and racially unequal, and the spatial manifestation of that, spatial segregation, is more pronounced in large urban areas @krupka_are_2007. In the US, roughly one in 6 urban residents live in poverty, and it is increasing faster in the suburbs @kneebone2023post.

Public health challenges in cities have also become increasingly critical, with a highly dense urban environment amplifying the risks of disease transmission, chronic illnesses, and healthcare inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored these vulnerabilities, as densely populated areas experienced higher transmission and more deaths @stier2021 and with a higher impact, particularly on marginalized communities. Beyond pandemics, urban lifestyle contributes to higher rates of non-communicable diseases, like diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory disorders @IPCC2022. Mental health issues are also more pronounced in urban settings, driven by our stressed, socially isolated, and economically pressured lifestyles @stier_evidence_2021.

Other problems like affordable housing, crime, climate change, and resilience to natural disasters are also prevalent worldwide. While highly optimized to serve residents in normal periods, city infrastructure lacks the redundancy needed during natural disasters, rising sea levels, and present and future climate changes like larger heat waves. The recent hurricanes in the US, the floods in Europe, or the wildfires in Australia are just a few examples of how cities are not prepared for these challenges @IPCC2022 and they suffer from the same logistical, infrastructure, social, and economic problems during natural disasters.

Cities are not just home to a larger share of the global population and its consequences. What makes cities particularly compelling for study is that these challenges – whether they involve housing, transportation, public health, or climate change – are pervasive across nations, transcending cultural, economic, and political boundaries. This universality provides a unique opportunity to identify patterns, test solutions, and share globally applicable insights, regardless of local context.

Thus, cities are not only the epicenter of our society, their opportunities and challenges, but also by examining and studying them, we gain a better understanding of most of our society and of how shared problems manifest and evolve in the world, paving the way for scalable solutions that benefit urban populations worldwide.

# Computational

Traditional approaches to studying urban challenges relied heavily on static and periodically collected data like censuses, which offered limited insight into the behavior of residents and collective dynamics in cities. The most important limitation is that those surveys are shaped by the assumption that "you are where you live", with residential location as the primary determinant of life outcomes such as education, income, and life expectancy. Census and survey data, while foundational, reflect this perspective by emphasizing static residential patterns. Sometimes, census areas are complemented by accessibility metrics, such as schools, hospitals, or grocery stores, that is, how many resources are at a short distance from a person's residence. Incredibly, these two ideas, *residential anchoring* and *proximity-based accessibility*, are the basis of modeling human behavior in traditional Urban Science and are still used by governments, researchers, and even companies when designing and implementing policies.

However, the explosion of data from smartphones, sensors, and online platforms has transformed our ability to study human behavior and its intertwined dependence with urban areas beyond our residence @moro2022city @saiz_understanding_2023. Large-scale, high-resolution datasets provide a more comprehensive view, capturing not only where and how people live but also how they move around the city and interact in their activity spaces, not just their residential areas. By integrating real-time behavioral data, researchers can better understand how urban environments shape outcomes and design interventions that consider the full spectrum of where and how people live their lives, not just where they sleep. In the end, **everything happens somewhere,** and thus, geographical contexts, our own urban lifestyles, and the behavior of our neighbors heavily modulate our actions.

::: callout-note
## How large is large-scale data?

When we refer to large-scale data we typically mean data that represents a large fraction of the population in urban areas, that includes a significant coverage of those people's behavior and that spans multiple dimensions, like categories of activities, means of transportation, demographics, etc. Broadly speaking, we can say that large-scale datasets contains millions or billions of structured (e.g. tabular data) and unstructured data (e.g. mobility trajectories, satellite images, or social media text) that require advanced tools for storage, processing, analysis, and visualization tools.

## Sources of large-scale urban data

The main source of large-scale urban data comes from our mobile phones. Digital traces from mobile phone apps, social media, credit card transactions, calls, and texts now provide unprecedented insights into how people move, interact, and make decisions in urban spaces. Most of the activities on our mobile phones are geo-localized to give more geographical context about our activities. Companies collect and use that information for their operations. For example, your mobile phone operator needs to know from where you are placing your call or downloading data to provide you with the service. Credit card companis might use your geolocation from your mobile phone to prevent fraudulent operations with your card. Ride-sharing services use mobile phone locations to find the best routes and also available drivers for each ride. The collection of these data across users, time, and geographies creates vast geo-localized datasets about individuals and where, what, and when their decisions are made.

![Trajectories in the Boston area obtained using GPS mobility data](images/trajectories.jpg){fig-align="left" width="600"}

The other source of large-scale urban data comes from imagery datasets. In recent years, advances in satellite technology and aerial and street imaging have provided high-resolution, frequently updated visual and non-visual data of urban environments. In recent years, the advent of the *low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite* constellations has allowed capturing of detailed (up to 1-meter resolution) and frequent (daily or even hourly intervals) urban environments. This opens new possibility for monitoring urban growth, economic development, mapping infrastructure or informal settlements, assessing environmental changes, and responding to disasters in real time.

![Super-resolution (15cm) imagery from the [WorldView-3 Maxar mission](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/worldview-3)](images/worldview-3.jpg)

Most of this high-resolution imagery is commercial, but some of them are made freely available for scientific use, like the European Union's [Sentinel](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/), the [Copernicus](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) services, or the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). Some private companies also offer the possibility to access that imagery through their map applications, like Google or Mapbox.

Finally, the rise of sensors and the "smart city" revolution has transformed urban data collection, providing a continuous stream of high-resolution information about city operations and resident activities. Embedded in infrastructure like traffic lights, public transportation systems, waste management facilities, and utility grids, these sensors enable real-time monitoring of urban systems. Smart city platforms aggregate and analyze this data to optimize resource allocation, reduce energy consumption, and improve public services. For example, sensors in traffic lights can adjust signal timing based on congestion, while air quality sensors monitor pollution levels to inform environmental policies.

## AI and Machine Learning for Urban Insights

The explosion of urban data has happened as advances in analytical techniques, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have revolutionized our ability to process and interpret complex datasets. Traditional statistical methods fall short to handle the scale, variety, and dynamic nature of large-scale datasets. For example, deep-learning computer vision can easily classify satellite imagery to monitor urban development. At the same time, modern causal inference methods like propensity matching, synthetic control or difference-in-difference can help disentangle relationships between variables, revealing for example how urban interventions affetc behaviors and outcomes.

Most of the data used in Computational Urban Science is large-scale. Thus, we need highly efficient methods to store and preprocess the data. For example, most big datasets are on cloud storage platforms in efficient data formats (e.g. [`parquet`](https://parquet.apache.org)) or platforms designed for spatial data like [`PostGIS`](https://postgis.net), [`Google BigQuery`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) or [`Snowflake`](https://www.snowflake.com/en/). They also require fast in-memory (`spark`, `python` or `R`) or GPU processing tools.

At the same time, most data is complex and unstructured, so various algorithms must be used to transform or adapt it to understand urban challenges. Modern computer vision, natural language processing, deep learning, time series forecasting, pattern recognition, spatial analysis, or causal inference algorithms are in the typical toolset of Computational Urban Science researchers and practitioners.

## Opportunities of large-scale urban data

Large-scale datasets are at the heart of the revolution behind Computational Urban Science. Here, we list some of the reasons:

-   **Higher-resolution information at both temporal and spatial scales** in urban settings. That high resolution alone already provides a new way to look into problems like natural disasters, transportation, commercial activity, or housing by monitoring in real-time or nowcasting processes in urban areas at unprecedented, almost individual, resolutions. A paramount example of this is using high-resolution mobility data during natural disasters or the recent COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing anonymized mobile phone location data, researchers can track evacuation patterns in real-time or response to adherence to stay-at-home measures. This level of resolution enabled emergency responders to allocate resources more efficiently.

-   **Addressing the causal question:** However, the potential of big data in urban science extends far beyond the high-resolution paradigm of real-time monitoring and nowcasting. Its true transformative power lies in its ability to address the **causal question**, uncovering the "why" behind urban dynamics rather than merely observing the "what", "who", "where" and "when". This shift from descriptive to causal inference marks a paradigm in urban science, enabling researchers and policymakers to identify the mechanisms driving urban phenomena. In general, causal inference requires more statistical power and careful theoretical design than simple descriptive findings. Unlike controlled laboratory settings, Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), the gold standard for causal inference, are often unfeasible or impractical in urban settings due to ethical, logistic, or public concerns. Large-scale data offers a unique opportunity to address thes issues through observational causal inference either by identifying and analyzing **natural experiments** (e.g., new transit lines, natural or economic shocks), **individual experiments** (e.g. changes of job, residence, lifestyles) or by designing **quasi-experiments** using counterfactual machine learning techniques like Synthetic Control. Furthermore, large-scale data and modern causal machine techniques allow us to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, ensuring that policies are not only effective but also equitable.

-   **Detecting small-scale effects**: Even extensive surveys and data collection in urban areas only represent a small fraction of the population. For example, the mobility surveys of city Departments of Transportation in the US typically consist of phone surveys of around 3000 people (e.g., [NYC DOT mobility survey](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml)), or the [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) in the US typically includes a sample size of around 26,000 individuals per year. This limited sample size lacks the granularity to capture subtle variations in behavior, especially among underrepresented groups or in very localized areas or extended in time. Contrary to large-scale effects like COVID-19 confinement, working-from-home policies, or the effect of massive migrations or natural disasters, most policies and interventions in urban areas affect a small percent of the population, and their effect on them is typically small. Large-scale data enables the detection of small-scale effects with much greater precision. For example, a natural experiment of a series of strikes on the London Underground in February 2014 enabled a fraction of commuters to find better routes. Using travel card IDs large-scale data, it was found that only around 5% stuck with these new routes after the strike was over @larcom2017.

-   **Uncovering complex urban interdependencies**: Unlike traditional data collection methods, which often operate in silos, large-scale datasets (especially those coming from human activity) can be integrated to reveal how disparate systems in urban areas –like public transit, housing affordability, and air quality- are intricately linked. For example, high-resolution mobility data can show how changes in public transportation routes influence ridership and experience segregation, housing demand, or local air pollution levels. Cities are inherently complex systems characterized by a dense network of interconnected components –people, infrastructure, business, institutions, and environment– interacting across multiple spatial and temporal scales. That complexity is what makes cities resilient and fragile at the same time to urban challenges. Understanding these interactions is then essential to address those challenges, and only by using large-scale datasets can we understand urban systems holistically.

## Challenges of large-scale urban data

The use of large-scale datasets also presents several challenges for Urban Science. Most problems come from understanding the data, how it is collected, who is represented, how it can be accessed, and privacy concerns. Here, we evaluate some of them succinctly.

-   **Large-scale Data** $\neq$ **Truth**. Large-scale datasets, while detailed and massive, never reflect reality perfectly. Data is shaped by the method and biases inherent in its collection, pre-processing, and interpretation. Thus, we should be careful when taking data at its face value. This limitation applies even to data specifically designed for research, such as Census data or satellite imagery. However, it becomes even more critical when dealing with **repurposed data**, collected for purposes unrelated to research and later adapted for scientific inquiry. A typical example is mobile phone or social media data, initially gathered by companies for marketing or commercial use, which is repurposed to study phenomena like mobility, disease spread, segregation, or other urban challenges. The most critical challenges of repurposed data are @salganik2019bit

    -   **Bias / representativity**: many large-scale datasets are not representative samples from some well-defined populations. Repurpose data is typically an incomplete description of the behavior of individuals, groups, or urban areas, and some groups might be completely neglected. This can result in conclusions that fail to generalize or systematically disadvantage underrepresented populations. Repurposed data typically comes from mobile phones or social media, platforms where young, high-income urban people are overrepresented. Demographic, temporal, and geographical biases can distort our understanding of urban challenges. Several techniques, like pre- or post-stratification or comparison with other datasets can alleviate the problem or check the robustness of our results when doing out-of-sample predictions at the population level. This step, typically neglected in many articles taking large-scale data at face value, is paramount to leverage the insights from large-scale data for population-wide interventions and policies.

    -   **Drifting**: large-scale data also presents an opportunity to study urban areas longitudinally. For example, during COVID19 mobility data from mobile phones was used to study people's movements between different areas across different virus waves to understand the effect of non-pharmatheutical interventions. However, that mobility data comes from users of different apps and because of that, the sample of users included in the data is constantly changing. At the same time, changes in the privacy settings of our mobile phone operating systems and people's perception of their own privacy in the last years have made it increasingly difficult for apps to collect location data. As a result, the sample of users and the type of data included in those repurposed datasets is constantly changing and thus, we need to implement frequent test and pre- and post-stratification techniques to alleviate the data drifting.

    -   **Algorithmically confounded**: Since repurposed data is collected for commercial uses it is typically affected by the algorithms companies use to promote their use and creation. For example, very recent large-scale study on Facebook found that its algorithm plays little role in driving political polarization @guess2023 . However, some researchers [argue](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp9364#elettersSection) the paper is flawed because, during the study, Facebook instituted a series of emergency changes to its algorithm to reduce the spread of misinformation. Unfortunately, dealing with algorithmic confounding is particularly difficult because many details of those algorithms are proprietary. This problem can be partially solved by keeping an open approach from the companies to share their data and how it is collected and processed, as we will argue below.

    -   **Dirty**: large-scale data is used for commercial purposes and is not collected or stored with research standards. As a result, data can be duplicated, noisy, incomplete, wrongly annotated, or truncated unintentionally. Even worse, it can get dirty by some users who intentionally create fake data. For example, a German performance artist carried a [cart full of smartphones](https://www.pcmag.com/news/artist-manipulates-google-maps-traffic-view-with-cart-full-of-smartphones#:~:text=A%20German%20performance%20artist%20has,smartphones%20around%20the%20German%20city) in different streets of Berlin to trick Google Maps into indicating that traffic was terrible in those areas. Removal of this intentional fake or dirty data can be difficult. Although outlier techniques can help alleviate the problem, the best way to avoid it is to understand how your data is created as much as possible.

-   **Data accessibility:** Many large-scale datasets are controlled by private corporations or require significant financial resources. This creates a disparity in who can use the data, limiting it to well-funded institutions or organizations with established partnerships. As a result, smaller municipalities, community organizations, and researchers in low-resource settings may be excluded from leveraging these insights, perpetuating inequalities in urban research and policy-making. Regulated access to those datasets, data cooperatives and partnerships between companies, researchers, and government, or public releases of anonymized datasets might ensure broader and more equitable use of urban data. Initiatives like open data portals or collaborative "data-for-good" programs exemplify how these partnerships can foster inclusivity and innovation. Accessibility goes beyond the actual data. Researchers need to understand how the data is collected and processed and what changes or algorithm companies are implementing in the creation of those datasets.

-   **Privacy and Ethical Concerns:** The granular nature of urban data, especially behavioral data, raises significant privacy concerns. Even anonymized datasets can sometimes be re-identified, exposing sensitive information about individuals. For example, it is possible to identify unique individuals in highly anonymized datasets by only knowing a small set of places they went to @demontjoye2013. Ethical considerations around consent, data usage, and potential misuse of findings must be central to using these datasets. Surveillance risks and inequity could threaten the potential benefits of urban large-scale data without proper measures.

-   **Complexity:** large-scale data is typically very complex, multi-faceted, and interconnected, reflecting the intricate nature of urban systems and their dynamics. Understanding and using large-scale urban data requires technical expertise in data science, network science, machine learning, causal inference, and domain knowledge of urban systems. However, misinterpretations can arise when data is analyzed with over-simplistic methods or without adequate understanding of its context or limitations. For instance, because we are dealing with large-scale datasets, there is always the possibility of finding spurious correlations between two urban phenomena, which might be mistaken for causation, leading to misguided policies @calude_deluge_2017.

## Recommendations to work with large-data sets

-   Data $\neq$ truth, so always try to alleviate biases, noise, or other problems using statistical techniques like re-sampling, outliers detection, etc.

-   Compare your data to other datasets, even if they are smaller or aggregated.

-   If your study is longitudinal, alleviate those problems also along the temporal dimension.

-   Learn how the data is collected, the algorithms, and even the technologies used to collect it.

# Science

Urban Science is characterized by its focus on understanding urban issues by integrating disciplines such as sociology, geography, economics, and planning. While Computational Urban Science can be viewed as an extension of Urban Science, incorporating more advanced data-driven and computational methodologies, these innovations have fundamentally transformed the field. The scale, precision, and analytic depth offered by computational approaches have reshaped how urban challenges are studied and addressed, to the extent that Computational Urban Science can be considered a distinct and rigorous discipline in its own right.

One crucial characteristic of Computational Urban Science is the different dimensions of the problem under study. Urban studies focused on urban planning, transportation, urbanization, housing, environmental sustainability, public health, resilience, inequality and segregation, governance, epidemics, economic growth, and many others. However, not all these problems are equal in their nature and scope of research. Most involve understanding the relationship between human behavior, urban environment, and societal outcomes. Thus, we can say that most of them resemble challenges in both social sciences and hard sciences. For instance, issues like transportation infrastructure or environmental sustainability can be well-framed using computational optimization tools, atmospheric models, and simulation models because they are highly predictable. In transportation, for example, most people try to optimize the route between home and work, and thus, predicting people's behavior in early commuting is very simple. However, problems like segregation, crime, or specific consumer choices depend on highly unpredictable human behavior, cultural contexts, or policy impacts. Even the same problem can have both aspects; for example, it is very easy to predict that individuals will go for lunch after working in the morning, but the place they choose might be more difficult to predict. Thus, we can then say that some challenges in urban areas are "harder" because they depend on more predictive people's behavior, and some are "soft" because they depend heavily on cultural, individual, geographical, and political contexts that unpredictably modify people's behavior. Interestingly, large-scale data and better computational tools are blurring the line between "soft" and "hard" problems. For example, decades ago, it was very hard to understand or predict store patronage, the segregation of people in their daily moves, the risk of getting infected by attending an event, or the impact of transportation policies on business. However, with advancements in data collection and analysis, we now have a much better understanding of how people move around the city, choose their activities, and react to policies. Computational Social Science has emerged as a discipline that has transformed how we understand these long-standing problems, enabling urban researchers from descriptive observations to predictive and prescriptive analytics.

Another crucial change that Computational Social Science has facilitated to challenge the prevailing urban science paradigm that the "City is a tree." Traditionally, early studies in urban science were based on the hierarchical "Environment-Behavior-Outcome" paradigm in which changes in urban environments create different behaviors of people that result in different social or economic outcomes. For example, new transportation routes (environment) may lead to people leaving their cars at home (behavior) and creating less pollution in some areas (outcome).

![Traditional (solid) versus current (solid + dashed) view of urban challenges](images/traditional.jpg){fig-align="left" width="600"}

This view of urban challenges as one problem depending and affecting only other problem was challenged during the second part of the 20th century, specially by the works of Jane Jacobs @jacobs_death_1993 and Christopher Alexander @alexander2017city. **Cities are complex networks** shaped by individual and collective behavior, economic activities, and urban environments simultaneously. As a result, most urban challenges depend on systems of systems, where a particular change of behavior can affect different societal outcomes, where societal outcomes can also modify our behavior, and our behavior can also modify urban environments. For example, here is a manually annotated causal map of how environmental health socio and economic systems were intertwined during the COVID-19 pandemic.

![A preliminary causal diagram demonstrating the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic environmental–health–socio–economic system. From @sahin_developing_2020](images/systems-08-00020-g001.png){fig-align="left" width="600"}

Small surveys, designated to answer only a particular question or to understand a particular problem, are insufficient to understand these complex systems. Large-scale data and computational tools are needed to understand how these systems interact, how they are affected by policies, and how they can be modified to achieve better outcomes. This is the core of Computational Urban Science, the **study of urban challenges as complex systems of systems**, where human behavior, urban environments, and societal outcomes are intertwined and affect each other.

Finally, Computational Urban Science goes beyond merely analyzing large-scale data or modeling large urban systems of systems. Using more granular and extensive data across cities has allowed the establishment of a set of scientific rules or laws that define the core principles of human behavior in cities to generate meaningful, actionable, and transportable knowledge across them. While some of these principles, such as the "Laws of Geography" @leitner2018laws or the "Gravity Law" @zipf1946 were already established, large-scale data has allowed researchers to refine these laws and uncover entirely new patterns and relationships within urban areas. For example, the traditional model Gravity Model of mobility, was refined using large-scale data by the Radiation Model @simini_universal_2012, which considers the attractiveness of areas to people and how that attractiveness can be modified by the presence of other areas, or the Universal visitation Law of human mobility @schlapfer_universal_2021 than also considers the frequency of visitation to places. Or by the recent work on the "Laws of Urban Scaling" @bettencourt2007growth, which shows that many urban outcomes, like GDP, crime, or innovation, scale super-linearly with city size. These laws are not only descriptive but also predictive, allowing researchers to forecast urban outcomes, design interventions, and evaluate policies across different urban areas.

![Scaling of urban infrastructure and socio-economic output, from @bettencourt_origins_2013](images/bettencourt2013.png){fig-align="left" width="600"}

Computational Urban Science has allowed also to understand the emergence of those laws by finding the microscopic rules that generate them. For example, the "Law of Urban Scaling" can be explained by a small set of basic principles that operate locally, or the "Universal visitation Law of human mobility" can be explain by the Gravity law and the Exploration and Preferential dynamics of visitations in human mobility. Interestingly, these universal laws appear in different geographical, cultural, and societal contexts. In most cases the reason is that they reflect the macroscopic emergence of those universal laws despite very different microscopic behaviors of individuals, similar to the emergence of macroscopic patterns in nature despite microscopic differences. This is also at the core of Computational Urban Science, the study of how local interactions between individuals, urban environments, and societal outcomes generate universal laws that can be used to understand, predict, and modify urban challenges across different urban areas. Despite their universality, these laws present important local variations, which can be used to design better policies, evaluate interventions, and forecast urban outcomes across different urban areas.
