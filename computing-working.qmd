Our course server, `stella.northeastern.edu` is an Ubuntu machine. The following instructions will help you set up and use Rstudio, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebooks to work on the server and access the data.

## Data

All data for the course will be in the

``` bash
/data/CUS
```

folder. You will have permissions to access the data but not to write on that directory. If that is needed, please get in touch with the instructors.

## Home Directory

You can write your scripts, other data, and final analysis and plots in your home director,y which will be

``` bash
/home/student1
```

Your home directory contains the folder `labs` where you can find the Quarto notebooks for each of the labs.

## Coding

### Using Rstudio

You can work **on** the server using RStudio Server. Open a browser on your local machine and navigate to:

``` bash
http://stella.northeastern.edu:8787
```

-   Your login and password are the same as your credentials to access the server
-   You will we working from your home directory in the server. You can export the final analysis and plot using the "Files" tab or use a SFTP tool to connect to your account in `stella`

### Using Visual Studio Code

1.  Verify that you can connect to `stella` using SSH by running the following command from a terminal in your computer. Change the `studentX` login as appropriate.

``` bash
ssh studentX@stella.northeastern.edu
```

2.  **Optional:** While password-based authentication to access `stella` using SSH is supported, we recommend setting up **key base authentication** for `stella`. See the [Tips and Tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_configuring-key-based-authentication) at the VSCode homepage.

3.  Open `vscode` and click on the Extensions panel button. Install the [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)

4.  In `vscode` select **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..** or use the \*\*Remote Explorer\* on the left sidebar

5.  Add a new connection using the same `studentX@stella.northeastern.edu` as in step 1.

6.  After a moment, VS Code will connect to the SSH server and set itself up.

7.  Once connected, you will see an empty window. Open any folder or workspace in the remote machine using the usual *File* menu.

See more instructions in the [VS Code Remote Development using SSH page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)

### Using Jupyter Notebooks

JupyterLab is available in `stella`. Open a browser window and navigate to

``` bash
https://stella.northeastern.edu:8000
```

-   Again, your login and password are the same as your server access credentials.
-   You will be working from your home directory on the server.
