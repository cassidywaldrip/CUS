Welcome back! This week, we will dive deeper into the use of administrative data from the census and look at how we can generate insights about urban dynamics by combining census data with other spatial features. Our lecture will walk through the availability of census data, how to reference census data spatially, and common considerations when using census data. In our practical exercise, we will explore census data in Boston. Then, we will combine census data with urban features from Open Street Map.
